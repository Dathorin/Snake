# Snake
This is my personal implementation of the classic game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). In this version the objects you must collect are mice that move erratically. New to this version is the ability for the snake to sprint, sacrficing the ability to turn sharply in order to quickly cross the field.

The snake's direction is controlled by the w, a, s, and d keys. The game can be paused or resumed by pressing space bar.  To sprint hold down the shift key. All of these key bindings can be changed in the options menu.
